Hi there!

My name is Travis and I’m currently an aspiring web developer.  This blog will chronicle my journey from a novice web developer, with very little background in computer programming, to someone with greater technical expertise and (hopefully) a professional career in web development.  Through this blog, I hope to not only solidify my own understanding of all the essential concepts in web development by explaining those concepts in my own words, but also to offer knowledge, insight, and advice to anyone considering or embarking upon their own journey in web development.

A little about me:

Up to this point in my adult life, I have been a person consumed by ideological ambitions, but I have not been exactly pragmatic when considering career goals.  After high school, I spent four years obtaining a degree in Biblical Studies from a small, unaccredited Bible college in the Midwest, only to eventually realize that I didn’t have the faith to pursue a career as a minister.  I then obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science from an Ivy League university (Columbia University in NYC), only to quickly become disillusioned and realize that I didn’t have the stomach to work in politics.  

Throughout the years, I had considered learning computer programming (as I have a few friends and relatives who work in the field), but I wasn’t sure if I had the chops for it.  However, during my senior year at Columbia, I decided to take a couple of introductory computer programming classes as electives and I discovered that I not only did well in the classes but I also really enjoyed programming!  An acquaintance of mine told me about coding boot camps and, after doing some research into different boot camps, I applied and got accepted into Flatiron School’s Online Web Developer Program.  Currently, I am working through the program at my own pace while simultaneously working a job in sales in Brooklyn, NY.

Why did I decide to learn software development?

There are a few reasons I decided to learn software development.  First, I love how coding gives you the power to create.  As long as the technology exists, computer programming can allow you to create almost any sort of program you can imagine.  If the technology doesn’t exist, it’s probably only a matter of time before someone invents it (maybe even you or me)!

Second, I love the problem-solving side to computer programming.  In my computer science classes at college and my current coding boot camp, I’ve loved the feeling of finally getting a program to do what I wanted it to do after spending long amounts of time trying to figure out an appropriate solution.

Finally, and not least importantly, I love the facts that I’m learning practical skills that are desired by many employers and that have the potential to lead me on a path of greater career and financial stability.  After having had such an impractical approach to career planning up to this point in my life, I hope that gaining some useful coding skills will help me to achieve a successful and fulfilling career in web development.

Well, that’s all for now, folks!  I hope you find this blog useful and enjoyable and I’m looking forward to seeing how it develops going forward!

Best,

Travis (the Web Developer)
