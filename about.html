<p>After obtaining degrees in Biblical Studies and Political Science, and later realizing that neither would lead me to a career I would find satisfying, Iâ€™ve decided to study computer programming in order to embark upon a career in web development.  Through this blog, you will be able to watch me grow from someone with only a basic understanding of coding to someone with greater technical expertise.  Ultimately, I hope that it will help you (the reader) in your own journey of learning to code and beginning your own career as a web developer.</p>
